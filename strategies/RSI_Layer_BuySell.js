// RSI Layer Buy/Sell
//
// (designed for hourly TF)
//
// If RSI goes below 30, wait for it to stay below 30 for 5 candles, 
// then buy with 1/10th of portfolio. Repeat at every subsequent candle 
// that RSI is under 30 until 100% exposed or RSI > 30. Then sell 50% 
// if RSI > 70 and current price > average buy price. Sell the remaining 
// 50% the next time RSI > 70 or current price <= the median of last sell 
// and average buy price. Sell if price drops below 1% of average buy 
// price. Also sell if RSI doesn’t reach 70 in 48 candles.

// This only works with this modded version of Gekko
// https://github.com/crypto49er/moddedgekko
